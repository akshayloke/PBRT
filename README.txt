This is a README for Akshay Loke's version of the PBRT implementation by Matt Pharr and Greg Humphreys. I will be adding my own optimizations and twists to this. 
One of these will be an OpenGL based render window for visualizing the render results rather than only saving them as an image.
Also, further down the road will be an attempt to author this as a Maya plugin.
